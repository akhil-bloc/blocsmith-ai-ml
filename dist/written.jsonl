User preferences and account settings\n- **Admin Panel**: `/admin-panel` - Moderate entries and manage users\n\n\n\nBy prioritizing both performance and usability in equal measure, we deliver an application that responds quickly to user interactions while maintaining an interface that guides users intuitively through even complex multi-step processes.## Feature Plan\n\nThe application will offer these primary features:\n\n- Multiple chat rooms\n- Direct messaging\n- Media sharing\n- Message search\n- User management\n\n### Access Control\n\n**Roles and Permissions:**\n\n- **Member**:\n  - `read:self`: Can read their own data\n  - `write:self`: Can create and update their own data\n\n- **Admin**:\n  - `read:any`: Can read any user's data\n  - `write:any`: Can create and update any data\n  -

Grid layout of images\n- **Image Detail**: `/image-detail` - Expanded image with metadata\n- **Collections**: `/collections` - Grouped sets of images\n- **Upload**: `/upload` - Add new images to the gallery\n- **User Profile**: `/user-profile` - User Profile page\n- **Admin Panel**: `/admin-panel` - Moderate entries and manage users\n\n\n\nBy implementing this comprehensive approach, we ensure that users of all technical backgrounds can easily navigate and utilize the full capabilities of the application without requiring extensive training or documentation.## Feature Plan\n\nWe've prioritized the following features for development:\n\n- User accounts\n- Image uploads\n- Collections\n- Search and filters\n- Social sharing\n\n### Access Control\n\n**Roles and Permissions:**\n\n- **Member**:\n  -
